<a name = "II"></a>

# II. Solution:
- We will review the first element in the array.
- If the array has that element, they use the "Remove" function in Python to remove that element and push the last element up.
- This happens continuously until the threshold i is no longer less than the length of the array.
- Finally we will return the reduced array.
